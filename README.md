# Hangman-Game
## This is a simple Hangman game implemented in JavaScript. The game randomly selects a word from predefined categories and allows the player to guess letters. The player has limited attempts to guess the word correctly before losing the game. The game provides visual feedback through a hangman drawing and displays the category of the chosen word.
### How to Play
The game starts by displaying a set of letters on the screen.
Click on a letter to make a guess.
If the guessed letter is present in the chosen word, it will be revealed in its corresponding position.
If the guessed letter is not present in the chosen word, the hangman drawing will be gradually displayed.
Continue guessing letters until you have successfully guessed the word or the hangman drawing is complete.
If you fail to guess the word within the given attempts, the game will end, and the correct word will be revealed.
If you successfully guess the word, a congratulations message will be displayed.
